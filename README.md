Mongo DB should be installed first for this app to work.
Install from mongo website

Simple python application that connects to a mongo database and automatically creates a todos collection within the test database.
It then uses the created collection to add a single note with `insert_one` then multiple notes with `insert_many`.

This project is just a simple implementation example
